Implement the exponent operator (pow): double mypow(double x, int n);

I implemented this in the naive way and also a faster way called Exponentiation by Squaring or Binary Exponentiation.  An explanation can be found here: https://www.rookieslab.com/posts/fast-power-algorithm-exponentiation-by-squaring-cpp-python-implementation
