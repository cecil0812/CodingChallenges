This is an implementation of a set class with a few special functions.  I saw this question being asked on Glassdoor.

The backend to my set is a BalancedTree which I also wanted to practice building since it had literally been decades since I had had to do it.

Everything is templated.  There is also some code to test running some set functions on vectors but this isn't really needed.
